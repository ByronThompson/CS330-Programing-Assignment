This is a JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Project

Source code is available under the src folder
	Movement AI implementation available under src\ai in the AISteer() method of each movement behavior
	Feel free to explore the rest of the source code. It's a bit overzealous for the scope of this assignment, but I entered a fey mood while making this and here we are
    The Project is implemented in 3D space rather than 2D space, however all current Scenarios use only x and z coordinates (y is 0)

There is an executable Jar file included in the Executable folder
	Running this jar will generate the same (or at least hopefully very similar) txt file as included in the same place as this readme
	Running the Jar from the console (Windows only, I think) will allow you to select different scenarios to run (currently there is only the scenario for PA1) or to design a custom scenario

The output of this program is included in the root of the submission, the same location as this readme as CS 330, Dynamic trajectory data.txt
	The included output and the output of the Jar use the behavior codes listed in the assignment document (1=Continue, 6=Seek, 7=Flee, 8=Arrive)
